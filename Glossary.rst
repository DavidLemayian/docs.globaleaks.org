Glossary
=====================
This is a list of jargon that is used inside of the GlobaLeaks software. Here we define it in a way to be unambiguous and uniform across all of their references.

   Receipt
	An access token that allows the Whistleblower to be authenticated to the secret (it effectively acts as a password) generated by GlobaLeaks Node and returned to the Whistleblower when a Submission has been completed. It enables the Whistleblower to modify and update the submission eventually uploading new files, adding comments to the Tip, and reading Receivers's comments about the submitted materials.
